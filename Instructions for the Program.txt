Instructions for the program:

Main Menu:

When you run the script, it will display a main menu with the following options:
Press 1 to Back Up a Directory.
Press 2 to Delete a Directory (Temporary or Permanent).
Press 3 to Restore a Directory.
Press E to Exit the program.
Back Up a Directory:

If you choose option 1, it will prompt you to enter the path of the source directory you want to back up.
The source directory should be enclosed in double quotes, and the script will check if it exists.
A timestamped backup folder will be created in the specified backup directory using robocopy to copy files and folders.
The program will ask if you want to back up another folder. Press Y for yes or any other key to return to the main menu.
Delete a Directory:

If you choose option 2, it will ask if you want to temporarily or permanently delete a directory.
For temporary deletion, it will move the selected directory to the "Deleted" folder.
For permanent deletion, it will completely remove the selected directory.
After deletion, it will ask if you want to delete another folder. Press Y for yes or any other key to return to the main menu.
Restore a Directory:

If you choose option 3, it will prompt you to select a directory from the "Deleted" folder to restore.
After restoration, it will ask if you want to restore another folder. Press Y for yes or any other key to return to the main menu.
Exiting the Program:

If you choose option E, the script will display an exit message and terminate after a short delay.
Invalid Input Handling:

The script includes input validation to handle invalid choices or inputs.
If you provide invalid input, it will display an error message and prompt you to enter a valid input.
Note:

Ensure that the script is executed with appropriate permissions to create directories and move files.
Make sure to back up important data before using the delete functions, as permanent deletion cannot be undone.
Feel free to run the script and follow the on-screen instructions. If you have any specific questions or issues, let me know!
