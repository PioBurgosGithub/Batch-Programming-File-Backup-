Clustered Systems
-sharing storage via a storage-area network (SAN)
-high-performance computing (HPC)
-distributed lock manager (DLM) to avoid conflicting operations

Multiprogramming (Batch system) 
-via Job Scheduling

Timesharing (multitasking) 



Process Management:
-process is a program in execution
- Program is a passive entity
- Process is an active entity.
- Process termination 
-Typically system has many processes, some user, some operating system running concurrently on one or more CPUs

Process Management Activities:
-Creating and deleting both user and system processes
-Suspending and resuming processes
-Providing mechanisms for process synchronization
-Providing mechanisms for process communication
-Providing mechanisms for deadlock handling

Memory Management
-Optimizing CPU utilization and computer response to users

Memory management activities
-Keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom
-Deciding which processes (or parts thereof) and data to move into and out of memory
-Allocating and deallocating memory space as needed

Storage Management
-OS provides uniform, logical view of information storage
-File-System management
	OS activities include
		Creating and deleting files and directories
		Primitives to manipulate files and directories
		Mapping files onto secondary storage
		Backup files onto stable (non-volatile) storage media

Mass-Storage Management
-Usually disks used to store data that does not fit in main memory 
-data that must be kept for a “long” period of time

OS activities
	Free-space management
	Storage allocation
	Disk scheduling

-WORM (write-once, read-many-times)
-RW (read-write)


Cache Coherency - in hardware such that all CPUs have the most recent value in their cache


I/O Subsystem
- hide peculiarities of hardware devices from the user
- Memory management of I/O including: 
	Buffering (storing data temporarily while it is being transferred), 
	Caching (storing parts of data in faster storage for performance), 
	Spooling (the overlapping of output of one job with input of other jobs)

Protection and Security:

User identities (user IDs, security IDs) include name and associated number, one per user
-User ID then associated with all files, processes of that user to determine access control

Group identifier (group ID) allows set of users to be defined and controls managed, then also associated with each process, file
Privilege escalation - allows user to change to effective ID with more rights


Computing Environments - Traditional:
-Stand-alone general purpose machines
-interconnect via wireless networks

Computing Environments - Mobile:
-Handheld smartphones, tablets, etc
difference between them and a “traditional” laptop?
- Extra feature – more OS features (GPS, gyroscope)
-Use IEEE 802.11 wireless, or cellular data networks for connectivity
-Apple iOS and Google Android

Computing Environments – Distributed:
Distributed computing
-Local Area Network (LAN)
-Wide Area Network (WAN)
-Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
-Personal Area Network (PAN)


Computing Environments – Client-Server:
Client-Server Computing
-Compute-server system: provides an interface to client to request services 
-File-server system: store and retrieve files

Computing Environments - Peer-to-Peer:
-P2P does not distinguish clients and servers
-Instead all nodes are considered peers
- act as client, server or both

Computing Environments - Virtualization:
-Emulation, in short, involves making one system imitate another. 

-Virtualization – OS natively compiled for CPU, running guest OSes  also natively compiled 
		- VMware
		- Host OS and Guest OS

Computing Environments – Cloud Computing:
-Delivers computing, storage, even apps as a service across a network

Public cloud – available via Internet to anyone willing to pay
Private cloud – run by a company for the company’s own use
Hybrid cloud – includes both public and private cloud components
Software as a Service (SaaS) – one or more applications available via the Internet (i.e., word processor)
Platform as a Service (PaaS) – software stack ready for application use via the Internet (i.e., a database server)
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – servers or storage available over Internet (i.e., storage available for backup use)

Cloud computing environments composed of traditional OSes, plus VMMs, plus cloud management tools


Computing Environments – Real-Time Embedded Systems:
- real-time OS
	-Real-time OS has well-defined fixed time constraints
	-Processing must be done within constraint
	-Correct operation only if constraints met


Open-Source Operating Systems
GNU/Linux and BSD UNIX
